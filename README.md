# GeoNamesProject
Practice using REST API's & rendering to a HTML document using AJAX & jQuery.

Description
-A simple HTML document to practice using REST API's.
-Due to this being a practice exercise the css is purposefully minimal. 
-The jQuery & AJAX logic could be streamlined into one function. Likeiwse the AJAX error functions could be improved to provide greater information. I opted to keep these breif as was not the main purpose of this project.
